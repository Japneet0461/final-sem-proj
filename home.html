                    <p class="text-dark">A research paper is a written report that presents original research or a review of existing research on a specific topic. It is a common form of academic writing that requires students and academics to locate information, take a stand on a topic, and provide support for their position. The structure of a research paper may vary depending on the assignment requirements, but it typically includes an abstract, introduction, literature review, methodology, results, discussion, recommendations, limitations, conclusion, acknowledgments, and references.</p>
